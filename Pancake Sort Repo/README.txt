To run my programs: 

Please compile all header files first(Node.h, Pancake.h, ANode.h) using g++

Then use g++ ANode.cpp Node.cpp Pancake.cpp hw1prx.cpp
to compile the source files 

My program takes input from the command line
with the first input being the number in the stack
and each succeeding entry being a diameter of a pancake

*note the flag -std=c++0x may need to be used to compile with unordered_set
this depends on the version of compiler used
